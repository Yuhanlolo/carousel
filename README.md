This is a coding exercise that creates an image carousel leveraging React-Bootstrap.

#### Checkout the working example quickly
The fastest way to checkout the demo is opening the `index.html` (under the build folder) with your browser.

#### Run the demo with live-server
1. If you don't have live-server installed already, run `npm install -g live-server` 
2. Go to the build folder and run `live-server`
3. Checkout the demo at http://127.0.0.1:8080/

#### Run the demo with serve
1. If you don't have serve installed already, run `yarn global add serve`
2. Go to the build folder and run `serve -s`
3. Checkout the demo at http://localhost:5000/

#### Test the React App locally
1. Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) set up.
2. In the project directory, install React-Bootstrap: `npm install react-bootstrap@next bootstrap`
3. Start testing: `npm start`
4. Checkout the demo at http://localhost:3000/
5. To add more images, just put the corresponding image urls into the imageUrls array.
