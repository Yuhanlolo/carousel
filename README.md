This is a coding exercise that creates an image carousel from scratch.

#### Check out the working example quickly
The fastest way to checkout the demo is opening the `index.html` (under the build folder) with your browser.

#### Run the demo with serve
1. If you don't have serve installed already, run `yarn global add serve`
2. Go to the build folder and run `serve -s`
3. Check out the demo at http://localhost:5000/

#### Test the React App locally
1. Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) set up.
2. Install node modules: `npm install`
3. Start testing: `npm start`
4. Check out the demo at http://localhost:3000/
5. To add more images, just put the corresponding image urls into the imageUrls array.
